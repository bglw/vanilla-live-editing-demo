    All content is derived from the front matter of the page. When using content in a layout, we add CloudCannon Visual Data Bindings around sections to provide editors the ability to click on the page and open a data panel containing that content.
  block_two: >-
    Additionally, for each element that uses content from the front matter we add our own data attribute containing this path. This is picked up by our custom vanilla javascript and used to update the page using the CloudCannon Live Editing API.
